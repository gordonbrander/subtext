# Subtext

## Speculative specification

- **Version**: 2021.10.10.dev
- **Status**: Draft
- **Authors**: Gordon Brander

This is a rough sketch of an actual spec for Subtext. It is becoming increasingly less rough over multiple passes. This doc is being shared in the spirit of working with the garage door open. Feedback is welcome!

**Warning to implementors**: Subtext is a hypothesis, an experiment, NOT a finished language proposal. We are actively putting it through its paces using practical prototypes. It may change in radical and breaking ways between now and a first stable release. 

## Overview

Subtext is a text-based, line-oriented hypertext format, designed for note-taking.

Subtext markup is made up of ordinary lines of text, which are interpreted as a list of blocks. Lines that are prefixed with magic "sigil" characters are treated as special blocks. Lines without sigils are treated as text blocks. Empty lines are ignored. Here's a quick sample:

```
# Heading

Plain text.

- List item
- List item

> Quoted text

URLs like https://example.com are automatically linked.

You can also link to local pages using short /slashlinks.
```

See the [guide](guide.md) to learn more about how to use Subtext.

Subtext is designed to be used in a wide range of settings, from simple command-line utilities, to advanced clients. It is extremely easy to parse, and can be rendered in a single pass, or even streamed.

## Design goals

### People goals

- **Markup for notes**. Subtext is meant for jotting down your thoughts, not for presentation, or publishing.
- **People-friendly**. We've settled on a syntax that is as close to plain text as we could manage. It has a passing resemblance to Markdown.
- **Hand-writeable**. We want to avoid imposing too much syntax on the user who is hand-editing Subtext. It should be possible to write ordinary lines of plain text, prose, and get a working document out of it.
- **Simple**: Subtext tries to do the simplest thing that could possibly work, even if it sometimes means sacrificing features.

### Computer goals

- **Easy to implement**. Clients can implement features that make sense for their use-cases, and fall back to plain text for unsupported features.
- **Composable and decomposable into component blocks**. You can compose documents from many small pieces, including from other Subtext documents.
- **Simple to meaningfully manipulate with software**. With a linear data model, the range of meaningful document structures is narrowed. this means you can make complex, yet meaningful programmatic decisions about how to manipulate it without having to understand as much about the structure and context of the specific document.

Using Subtext, you should be able to programmatically do things like:

- Excerpt documents by showing only the first text block
- Append this document to that one
- Select all quotes from a collection of documents
- Autogenerate a table of contents from all heading blocks in a document
- Select all links, and generate a graph for a collection of documents
- Find all backlinks and append them to the document as links

### Non-goals

Subtext is not a layout, presentation, or word processing format. The analogy to draw here is index cards, not books or manuscripts. Subtext deliberately avoids the kind of complex presentation features offered by publishing formats like HTML, PDF, and LaTex. It has no opinions about fonts, colors, sizes. It does not deal in scripting behavior.

We picture Subtext being used for note-taking systems, like as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). A publishing workflow might look like copy-pasting Subtext into a publishing tool to create an artifact, or perhaps exporting Subtext into another format, like HTML, and then editing it into shape.

This puts Subtext in a different category than complex markup languages like HTML5. It is closer in spirit to something like RSS or OPML. Subtext brings a minimal amount of semantic structure to linear documents. It is up to clients to decide how that structure is used and displayed.

## Sample document

```
# Overview

Evolution is a behavior that emerges in any system with:

- Mutation
- Heredity
- Selection

Evolutionary systems often generate unexpected solutions. Nature selects for good enough.

> There is no such thing as advantageous in a general sense. There is only advantageous for the circumstances youâ€™re living in. (Olivia Judson, Santa Fe Institute https://overcast.fm/+UtNTAcN2Y/13:36)

Evolving systems exist in /punctuated-equilibrium.

# Questions

- What systems (beside biology) exhibit evolutionary behavior? Remember, evolution happens in any system with mutation, heredity, selection.
- What happens to an evolutionary system when you remove mutation? Heredity? Selection?
- Do you see a system with one of these properties? How can you introduce the other two?

# See also

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_systems
```

## Line-orientation

Subtext is line-oriented. Lines can be parsed to blocks by checking if the leading characters of the line match one of a set of special character sequences. These special character sequences are called "sigils", and determine the block type of the line.

> Design note (non-normative): All sigils currently happen to be one characters. In future, we may introduce multi-character sigils. However, we will try to avoid multi-character sigils for reasons of aesthetics.

Note that the space after the sigil characters is NOT part of the sigil and is optional, but recommended.

```
# This is a heading
#This is also a heading
```

## Core block types

### Text blocks

Text blocks are the fundamental line type. Any line which does not match the definition of another line type defaults to being a text line.

Text lines SHOULD be presented to the user in a manner suitable for general reading. This SHOULD include wrapping text, where appropriate. Text lines MAY be formatted for reading at the client's discretion. For example, clients MAY choose to display text with variable fonts, leading and font-size appropriate to the context.

### Heading blocks

Heading blocks start with `#`. Heading blocks SHOULD be presented in a manner denotes that they are hierarchically "above", and "label" blocks below. This MAY mean typical typographic heading treatment in visual clients, such as increasing the font size as compared to text blocks, or displaying the text in bold. In non-visual clients, such as screen readers, this MAY mean announcing the block using a different voice style.

Clients MAY also create navigational affordances for headings, such as deriving a Table of Contents from heading blocks, or creating jump points in the scroll bar.

Subtext currently supports only one level of heading. This is a deliberate design choice, since a deep heading hierarchy is probably a sign your note needs to be refactored or unbundled into multiple notes. To construct deeply nested documents, you can link to other notes using a link block, instead. Supporting clients MAY read in these nested documents, embed them in-place, and adjust heading sizes as necessary, to denote heading level. Solving hierarchy through links encourages a hypertext method of writing, and allows pieces of a document to be used in more than one place.

### List blocks

List blocks start with `-`. List blocks SHOULD be presented in a manner that denotes they are items in a list. Visual clients MAY render list blocks with a bullet preceding. They MAY also choose to visually group contiguous list blocks together, for example, by removing the margins between them.

Subtext currently supports only one level of list. Our sense at this time is that the benefits of deep lists do not outweigh the costs of complicating the document format by introducing hierarchy. Clients MAY consider transcluding links to formats like `.yaml`, `.json`, or `.opml` to display deep lists.

### Quote blocks

Quote blocks start with `>`. Quote blocks SHOULD be presented in a manner that denotes they are quoted text. Visual clients MAY render quote blocks by indenting them, or by rendering them with a line to the left, as seen in many email clients. Non-visual clients, such as screen readers MAY read quote blocks in a different voice style denoting quotation.

### Blank lines

Each blank line in Subtext is parsed to a blank block.

For example, the following Subtext document:

```
I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast
```

Parses to blocks (expressed as Lisp pseudocode):

```
((text "I have eaten")
 (text "the plums")
 (text "that were in")
 (text "the icebox")
 (blank)
 (text "and which")
 (text "you were probably")
 (text "saving")
 (text "for breakfast"))
```

Blank blocks have no presentational meaning in Subtext, but are often used in markup source code for readability reasons.

Clients MAY ignore blank lines for the purpose of rendering.

However, parsers SHOULD NOT discard blank blocks. Instead, they SHOULD preserve them in the source representation, so that they may be written back out as blank lines when rendering markup.

When parsing, blank lines are defined as a [Universal Newline](#universal-newlines) that was preceded by either another Universal Newline, or START, a notional code point that represents the beginning of input.

Examples of blank lines (since space characters are invisible, the following examples are described using escape characters):

```
\n
\r\n
```

## Links

### Bare URLs

Subtext parsers MUST implement automatic linking for certain URLs that are not in brackets.

```
You can also just paste bare links, like https://example.com, and Subtext will try to sniff them out and automatically link them.
```

The grammar for URLs defined by [RFC1738 Uniform Resource Locators (URL)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738) is extremely general, and not practical to sniff out without false positives. To avoid ambiguities and false positives, autolinking is restricted to a few well-known protocols that can more easily be identified:

- `http`
- `https`

#### Parsing bare URLs

`http` and `https` bare URLs are conceptually valid URIs as defined by [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).

Parsing grammar:

```abnf
link = WB url WB
url = http-url / https-url
http-url = "http" ":" "/" url-body
https-url = "https" ":" "/" url-body
WB = SP / NL / START
SP = "\s" / "\t"
NL = CRLF / LF / CR
```

Where,

- `url` is conceptually a valid URI, as defined by [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), with the grammar described in that document. However implementations MAY use a simplified strategy for identifying and parsing URLs, described below.
- `url-body` is conceptually a sequence of characters that are valid in URIs, as defined by [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986). However implementations MAY use a simplified strategy, described below.
- `START` is a conceptual code point that signifies the beginning of a line, or input stream.


A simplified parsing strategy MAY be used for identifying bare URLs. Implementations that use a simplified parsing strategy to identify bare URLs SHOULD use the following strategy, described here as a regular expression:

```regex
(^|\s)(https?://[^\s>]+)[\.,;]?
```

Where the second capture group is the value of the link.

### Bracketed URLs

URLs are wrapped in angle brackets, and can appear anywhere within a text, link, or quote block:

```
Links are wrapped in angle brackets, like this <https://example.com>, and can appear anywhere in text.

You can also reference links with exotic protocols like <doi:10.1000/182>.
```

#### Parsing bracketed URLs

Grammar:

```abnf
link = WB "<" url ">" WB
WB = SP / NL / START
SP = "\s" / "\t"
NL = CRLF / LF / CR
```

Where:

- `url` is conceptually a URL as defined by [RFC1738 Uniform Resource Locators (URL)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738), However implementations MAY use a simplified parsing strategy for URLs, described below.
- `START` is a conceptual code point that signifies the beginning of a line, or input stream.

A simplified parsing strategy MAY be used for parsing URLs. Implementations that use a simplified parsing strategy to identify bare URLs SHOULD use the following strategy, described here as a regular expression:

```regex
(^|\s)<([^<>\s]+)>($|\s)
```

> *Design note*: bracket links are delimited by a word boundary (either beginning of line, or space) to avoid collision with other uses for brackets.

> *Design note*: bracket links disallow spaces. This allows parsers to reject partially-formed bracket links, without having to traverse the entire line. This is useful when live-rendering markup as user types.

### Slashlinks

Slashlinks are a shorthand markup meant to be used for linking to same-origin pages. To reduce ambiguity, slashlinks do not use full URL or path syntax, but instead use a restricted syntax that is easier to parse and identify.

Generally, a slashlink is a `/` followed by any number of alphanumeric characters, dashes `-`, underscores `_`.

Implementations are free to interpret the slashlink in whatever way works best for their goals. For example, the slashlink `/foo/bar` does not have to reference a file at path `/foo/bar`. For example, it could be used as a slug for a database lookup, or expanded into a file path, such as `~/Documents/Subconscious/foo/bar.subtext`. These are just examples.

#### Parsing slashlinks

```abnf
slashlink = WB hier-part [hier-part]
hier-part = "/" path-part
path-part = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_"
WB = SP / NL / START
```

Where:

- `START` is a conceptual code point that signifies the beginning of a line, or input stream.


Parsing slashlinks may be achieved via the following regular expression:

```regex
(^|\s)(/[a-zA-Z0-9\-_/]+)
```

Where the second capture group is the value of the slashlink.

> *Design note*: slashlinks are delimited by a word boundary on the leading side (either beginning of line, or space) to avoid collision with normal prose uses of the slash character.

### Rendering links

For all kinds of links, including bare URLs, bracket URLs, and slashlinks, the client MUST render some kind of user-interactable link to the referenced document. The client MAY choose what form this link takes.

The client MAY choose to render the text of the link in a way that denotes interactability, such as coloring the link blue, and giving it an underline.

For file types it understands, the client MAY render all or part of the linked document in-place (e.g. transclude). For example:

- A linked image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, etc) MAY be rendered in-place by the client and sized to fit its context.
- A linked video file MAY be rendered in-place, together with playback controls.
- A linked `.csv` file MAY be rendered in-place as a table.
- A linked Subtext file MAY be transcluded (linked while rendered in-place), rendered in-place in full, or excerpted and rendered in-place, depending on the use-case.
 
> *Design note (non-normative)*: By allowing you to reference other documents, it is possible to compose hypertext documents from many smaller documents. Rather than extending the syntax of Subtext to include features like tables, videos, or deeply nested lists, our sense is that a hypertext format allows these special types to be represented in their native file containers. This keeps Subtext simple, and allows data sources like `.csv`, or `.png` to be OPTIONALLY embedded in-place, while remaining valid file types that can be opened, edited, and used in other applications.

## Sigils reserved for future use

The following sigils are reserved for possible future use:

- `$`
- `@`
- `!`
- `%`
- `~`
- `|`
- `:`
- `*`
- `+`
- `=`
- `\`
- `Î»`
- `\s\s` (two or more contiguous space characters leading a line)
- `\t` (one or more contiguous horizontal tab characters leading a line)
- `---`

## Line breaks

Different systems use different character(s) for breaking lines. For example, Unix systems use `\n` (LF), while Windows uses `\r\n` (CRLF) (See [Wikipedia entry on newlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Representation)). Because Subtext is line-oriented, it specifies a strategy for normalizing line breaks.

The canonical line-break for Subtext is `\n` (LF).

Human authors of Subtext SHOULD use `\n` to delimit lines.

Software that writes Subtext MUST use `\n` to delimit lines.

Software that parses Subtext will accept several newline characters as line breaks: `\n`, `\r`, or `\r\n` (referred to as "Universal Newlines" elswhere in the spec). Subtext parsers MUST normalize newlines by interpreting `\r\n` (CRLF) and `\r` (CR) as equivalent to `\n`, using the following sequence of steps:

1. If `\r\n` is encountered, it is normalized to be equivalent to `\n` by the parser.
2. If `\r` is encountered, it is normalized to be equivalent to `\n` by the parser.

Other line break characters, including Unicode line-break characters such as `PS` and `LS` MUST NOT be treated as line delimiters for the purpose of Subtext parsing.

This strategy follows [Postel's Robustness Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle), to a degree. We standardize on a single line-break character, but will parse the most widely used alternatives.

## Mime Type and extension

The preferred file extension for Subtext is `.subtext`.

The Mime Type for Subtext is `text/subtext`. As a subtype of the top-level media type "text", "text/subtext" inherits the "charset" parameter defined in [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046). However, the default value of "charset" is "UTF-8" for Subtext "text" content.

Subtext is valid plain text and plain text is, in most cases, valid Subtext. In most cases it should be practically possible to read `.txt` files as Subtext, if a client wishes to.

## Appendix 1: Terminology

### Specification requirement levels

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Syntax Notation

This specification uses Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) to describe syntax. ABNF is specified in [IETF RFC 2234](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2234).

### Universal Newlines

When parsing, Subtext normalizes several line break characters. The following are all treated as line breaks when parsing: `\n`, `\r`, `\r\n`. See [line breaks](#line-breaks) for specific normalization steps.

Note that while Subtext parsers accept Universal Newlines, Subtext renderers only ever write Unix newlines (`\n`).

### Prior art

#### Ted Nelson's ELF

By an accident of convergent evolution, Subtext happens to have some structural resemblances to Ted Nelson's ELF format (Nelson, 1965).

#### Runic

[Runic](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/runic.html) is a small line-oriented wiki markup language. The simplicity and cleverness of Runic made me fall in love with the idea of line-oriented markup.

#### Project Gemini

[Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) is an internet protocol which aims to be "heavier than Gopher and lighter than the web." [Gemini features a line-oriented markup language](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi).

I discovered Gemini about a month after roughing out the outline for Subtext. I was excited about the idea of a minimal line-oriented syntax. Gemini gave me further confidence that line-orientated markup could be a solid basis for a hypertext format.

#### Markdown

Subtext has a passing resemblance to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Markdown is a popular plain text formatting systems among programmers. It features a familiar syntax that looks similar to the organic conventions of plain text email.

Markdown is meant to have HTML semantics, and compile to HTML. You can also embed arbitrary HTML within Markdown. By contrast, Subtext can be compiled to HTML, but is not specifically a "compile to HTML" language. Note [Subconscious](https://subconscious.substack.com/) will be shipping a native (non-browser) renderer for Subtext. It's important that we don't drag the whole web specification in behind us accidentally.

The original implementation of Markdown used regular expression string replacement, rather than parsing an AST. Many Markdown libraries take this approach. Few generate an AST.

Markdown does not have an official formal specification, only a reference implementation. Aspects of the syntax are ambiguous. This is a fine choice for a personal tool, and has encouraged organic extensions to the syntax, such as [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). On the other hand, it makes it difficult to treat Markdown itself as a standardized format intended to work across multiple clients. 

Specifications for various dialects:

#### Emacs Org Mode and Outline Mode

[Outline Mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Outline-Mode.html) and [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) are two popular plain text syntax flavors in Emacs.

[Syntax](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Outline-Format.html): Outline Mode is made up of headings (prefixed with one or more `*`), and text (unprefixed). The number of `*` determines the depth of the heading. Text below a heading is considered "belonging to" that heading, and together they make up an "entry".

Org Mode builds on Outline Mode, adding additional syntax for metadata, `[[wikilinks]]` and other features.

Things to appreciate about Outline Mode:

- It gets a lot of mileage out of a single primitive (`*`).
- It is a structured format. You can parse it into logical software-manipulable blocks.

Con: Forcing titles for logical blocks imposes a fair amount of abstract thinking when taking rough notes.

Note Org Mode is not strictly line-oriented. [It breaks paragraphs by one or more blank lines](https://orgmode.org/manual/Paragraphs.html).
