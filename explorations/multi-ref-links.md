# Multiple reference links

We could support providing multiple link sources through a space-separated list of URIs. A client could choose whichever one is best. This could allow for the coexistence of `http://`, and `ipfs://` links, for example.

```
& http://example.com http://example.mirror.com ipfs://exampleexampleexample dat://exampleexampleexample
