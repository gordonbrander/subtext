# Wikilinks and search links

"Any sufficiently advanced search is indistinguishable from a hyperlink". Rather than linking to file paths or URLs, links could include a search string, allowing a client to choose the best match from an index. This "search link" approach is inspired by [Notational Velocity's ](https://notational.net/) treatment of `[[WikiLinks]]` as search strings.

Important: we must consider how this would interact with [multiple reference links](multi-ref-links.md). How might the syntax for search strings and URLs be differentiable?
