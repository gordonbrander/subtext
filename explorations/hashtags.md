# Hashtags

We could explore expanding Subtext to include support for hashtags in text blocks:

```
There’s no such thing as advantageous in a general sense. It’s advantageous in the circumstances you’re living in. #evolution #ecology
```

Hashtags could be collected into a "tags" field of text blocks, and perhaps stripped from the text as well.

**OTOH**: Tags are just a backlinks to pages that don't exist. To use an OODA lens, tagging is O without ODA. Collecting into tagged buckets is not sense-making, only a coarse-grained first approximation. Sense-making should fold into Orientation, and make it possible to expand your repertoire of Actions. That means synthesizing collected information into new knowledge. This is something linking supports, and tags do not. So if we have to choose one primitive, Wikilinks are the better primitive.
