# JavaScript Subtext Parser

This is a JavaScript subtext parser with streaming capabaility.
It uses the
[Web Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API),
which means it can be used in compatible browsers and server runtimes like
Node.js and Deno. It does not have any dependency.

## Example

Required runtime: Node.js >18.10.0

This example must be run with Node.js as it uses the Node.js API to open
the example source file. The main parser however is runtime-agnostic.

`npm run example`

## Run tests

Required runtime: Node.js >18.10.0

`npm run test`
